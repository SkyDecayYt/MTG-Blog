# From Azorius to Jeskai: A Modern Control Deck Evolution

This post chronicles an in-depth deckbuilding session, starting with optimizing an Azorius Control list for the Modern metagame and evolving into a powerful Jeskai Control build. We'll explore card choices, meta-game considerations, and the iterative process of refining a competitive Magic: The Gathering deck.

## Phase 1: Optimizing Azorius Control

The journey began with two existing Azorius Control decklists. Our goal was to merge their strengths and tailor them for the current Modern metagame, which is dominated by aggressive creature decks (Boros Energy, Izzet Prowess, Domain Zoo) and "big mana" or combo strategies (Eldrazi Ramp, Tameshi Belcher).

**Initial Analysis & Refinement:**
We identified key differences between the two starting lists, particularly in their land bases and the inclusion of cards like The Wandering Emperor and Prismatic Ending. The second list's mana base, including a Breeding Pool for a more flexible Prismatic Ending, was deemed superior. However, the first list's inclusion of The Wandering Emperor was a significant advantage.

After several iterations, incorporating user feedback, we arrived at a streamlined 60-card Azorius Control list. Key decisions included:
*   Running a single copy of The Wandering Emperor.
*   Maximizing Prismatic Ending for early interaction.
*   Adjusting the land count to 24, including a basic Island for resilience.
*   Adding a second Day's Undoing and a second Wrath of the Skies for board control and combo potential.

**Theoretical Matchup Analysis:**
While direct playtesting isn't possible, we conducted a theoretical matchup analysis for the finalized Azorius list against the top meta decks. The deck showed promise against aggressive strategies due to its efficient removal and board wipes, but faced challenges against "big mana" decks like Eldrazi Ramp.

## Phase 2: Crafting the Sideboard

A robust sideboard is crucial for Modern. Our goal was to balance the main deck's weaknesses and include specific hate cards. A key requirement was the inclusion of four copies of Consign to Memory.

**Sideboard Evolution:**
Initial proposals included cards like Sunset Revelry and Dovin's Veto, but these were deemed too passive. The user preferred a more proactive approach, leading to the inclusion of:
*   **Harbinger of the Seas:** A powerful land disruption tool against greedy mana bases.
*   **Aether Gust (later replaced by Path to Exile):** For efficient, targeted removal.
*   **Mystical Dispute:** For counter-wars against blue decks.
*   **Rest in Peace:** A highly effective graveyard hate piece, clarified to be a full graveyard wipe, not just creatures.
*   **Stony Silence:** For artifact-based strategies.
*   **Force of Negation:** For critical non-creature spell disruption.

The final sideboard provided a balanced set of tools to adapt to various matchups.

## Phase 3: Shifting to Jeskai Control

The conversation then pivoted to a more ambitious goal: transforming the deck into Jeskai (Red/White/Blue) Control, incorporating powerful cards like Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury, Snapcaster Mage, Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student, and Flame of Anor, all while being mindful of budget constraints.

**Jeskai Mana Base & Card Integration:**
Adding a third color necessitated a significant overhaul of the mana base, introducing Steam Vents, Sacred Foundry, and Spirebluff Canal. The integration of new cards involved:
*   **Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury:** A resilient threat and removal piece.
*   **Snapcaster Mage:** For flashing back instants and sorceries (with budget noted as a potential concern).
*   **Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student:** A creature that transforms into a powerful planeswalker, requiring consistent card draw to flip.
*   **Flame of Anor:** A versatile spell offering removal, card draw, or artifact/enchantment destruction.

**Iterative Refinement of Jeskai:**
The Jeskai list underwent several rounds of refinement based on user preferences:
*   Cutting Orim's Chant for Spell Snare.
*   Adjusting Snapcaster Mage and Tamiyo counts.
*   Removing Narset, Parter of Veils to make space for more Phlage, Tune the Narrative, and Galvanic Discharge.
*   Streamlining the spell section by consolidating one- and two-of spells.
*   Adding Arena of Glory for legendary synergy.
*   Final adjustments to Tamiyo and Galvanic Discharge counts.

The final Jeskai list is a creature-heavy control deck, leveraging the strengths of all three colors with efficient interaction, resilient threats, and a powerful planeswalker suite.

This deckbuilding journey highlights the dynamic nature of Magic: The Gathering, where understanding the metagame, careful card selection, and iterative refinement are key to building a competitive deck.
